## Installing NR1 CLI
1. Make sure you have the `nr1` CLI installed on your machine. Run the following command:<br> ```command -v nr1``` <br> If nothing shows up, it's not installed yet. Proceed to the next step. If it is installed, feel free to disregard step #2 below.
2. Install the `nr1` CLI tool [here](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher). You can skip steps #5 and #6 in the Quick Start form as we'll run through these examples in this workshop.
    - **Important:** Make sure to do step **#4** of the Quick Start steps. This ensures your credentials are stored on your machine.

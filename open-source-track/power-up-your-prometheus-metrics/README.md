# Power up your Prometheus metrics with the Telemetry Data Platform

Metrics are the foundation of monitoring but can bring challenges as you scale. Increasing amounts of data, sources, and tools can mean troubleshooting takes more time, and data storage and access needs more consideration.

With the Telemetry Data Platform (TDP) you can bring all your open source metrics into a fully managed, scalable platform using OpenTelemetry standards.

In this hands-on workshop youâ€™ll integrate Prometheus metrics, link existing Grafana dashboards, and query your data in the data platform with the New Relic PromQL Query Builder.

# 5 Consolidating Your Data with New Relic’s Telemetry Data Platform
The age of microservices and DevOps has ushered observability to the forefront of the minds of practitioners.  While the resulting explosion of available telemetry data is generally a Good Thing, it has led to data sprawl and siloed tooling within teams and organizations.  In this hands-on session, you’ll learn how New Relic’s Telemetry Data platform makes it easy to ingest data from anywhere, across all of the M.E.L.T (Metrics, Events, Logs, and Traces) telemetry data types.  We’ll cover the building blocks of data ingestion, including New Relic’s Open Telemetry capabilities and Flex integration builder, and then we’ll visualize the data we’ve collected by querying NRDB, the world’s most powerful telemetry database.

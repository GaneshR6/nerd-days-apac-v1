# Reducing toil with Terraform

Learn to use the New Relic CLI to reduce the amount of toil in your daily tasks.

## Prerequisites

> **Important!** Please install software, create accounts, or follow any other instructions **before** attending this Nerd Days session. This will ensure that you're ready for the hands-on labs. We want you to spend your lab time learning, rather than setting up your environment.

To get the most value out of the following, you should have a basic understanding of Terraform (HCL semantics are not covered), and a New Relic account that you can test with.

1. [A New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) with the [Admin role](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles)
3. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) > 0.12.28
4. Application reporting to New Relic
5. [Set up your environment](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nerd-days-terraform#initial-setup)

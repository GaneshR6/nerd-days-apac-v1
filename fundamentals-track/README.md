# Nerd Day Fundamentals Track

Over the course of five sessions, you'll use New Relic to instrument a web app with front and back end monitoring, build dashboards and alert policies, add custom data to help you understand your business, and set up proactive functionality monitoring with a Synthetics scripted browser.

> **Note:** While each session in this track builds upon knowledge from the sessions before it, you can still learn from each session on its own.

# Nerd Day Fundamentals Track
The New Relic Nerd Days Fundamentals track will give you everything you need to get up and running with New Relic.

Over the course of 5 hours you will get a web application up and reporting to New Relic with front and back end monitoring, build dashboards and alert policies, add custom data to help you understand your business, and set up proactive functionality monitoring with a Synthetic scripted browser.

### Instrumenting your service using agents
In this session you will get started by setting up New Relic observability for a pre-built web application application.
You will set up:
APM (application performance monitoring) to understand the performance of the back end.
Browser monitoring to understand the user experience

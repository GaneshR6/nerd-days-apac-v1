# Testing in Production

How do you know your feature is working perfectly in production? If something breaks in production, how will you know? Will you wait for a user to report it to you? What do you do when your staging test results do not reflect current production behavior?

In order to test proactively, as opposed to reactively, try testing in production! You will have an increased accuracy of test results, your tests will run faster due to the elimination of bad data, and you will have higher confidence before releases. You can accomplish this through feature flagging, canary releases, setting up a proper CI/CD pipeline, and cleaning up your data.

At the end of the day, you don't care if your features work in staging, you care if they work in production.

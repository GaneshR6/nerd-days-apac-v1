# Writing Reliably Bad Software, AKA "How to get paid to write memory leaks"

It's super duper easy to create a free account on New Relic One, but now what? In this session, you'll learn about how New Relic is open sourcing the same magic we use to deliver demos for our sales organization. With a little bit of configuration, and some time, you too can go from having nothing in our New Relic One account to services, hosts, and a bit of managed chaos.

## Prerequisites

> **Important!** Please install software, create accounts, or follow any other instructions **before** attending this Nerd Days session. This will ensure that you're ready for the hands-on labs. We want you to spend your lab time learning, rather than setting up your environment.

1. [A New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup)

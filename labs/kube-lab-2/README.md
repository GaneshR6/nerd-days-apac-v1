# Integrating New Relic with Kubernetes - Lab 2

Welcome! This lab correlates with the _Integrating New Relic with Kubernetes_ talk from Nerd Days 2020. It is the second of three hands-on labs you'll walk through in your session.

In this lab, you'll:

- Deploy a Flask app in a local Kubernetes cluster
- Integrate New Relic with your cluster **using a custom manifest**

Enjoy your session!

## Prerequisites

To complete this lab, you need:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
- [A New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup)

Once you've installed the prerequisite software, you may begin the lab.

## Start Minikube

Minikube allows you to spin up a local, single-node Kubernetes cluster on your local machine.

Start a local Minikube cluster:

```console
$ minikube start --driver=docker
```

> **Note:** If you're using a different hypervisor, use your [driver](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/#specifying-the-vm-driver) instead of `docker`.

## Use Minikube Docker daemon

Instead of using a Docker registry for your image, you can build your Docker images inside Minikube's daemon. This simplifies some of the process of deploying your application.

First, run `minikube docker-env`, which sets some environment variables:

```console
$ minikube docker-env
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
export DOCKER_HOST=<host>
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=<cert path>
export MINIKUBE_ACTIVE_DOCKERD="minikube"

# To point your shell to minikube's docker-daemon, run:
# eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)
```

Second, if you haven't already, execute the last line from the output:

```console
$ eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)
```

## Create resources

In this lab, you'll deploy a small web app in Kubernetes. To do so, build the project's Docker image:

```console
$ docker build -t kube-lab-2 .
```

Then, apply the manifests in the `kube-manifests` directory:

```console
$ kubectl create -f kube-manifests
deployment.apps/kube-lab-2 created
service/kube-lab-2 created
```

Finally, check your resources to make sure they exist:

```console
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-lab-2-699c4f95b-tr4p7   1/1     Running   0          5s

$ kubectl get services
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
kube-lab-2   LoadBalancer   10.104.226.242   <pending>     5000:31065/TCP   28s
kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP          94s
```

## View your application

Notice the `kube-lab-2` load balancer service's pending `EXTERNAL-IP`. You need to expose the LoadBalancer on localhost, using `minikube tunnel` from a different terminal window:

```console
$ minikube tunnel
üèÉ  Starting tunnel for service kube-lab-2.
```

Now, you should see an `EXTERNAL-IP`:

```console
$ kubectl get services
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
kube-lab-2   LoadBalancer   10.99.10.112   127.0.0.1     5000:30300/TCP   15m
kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.96.0.1      <none>        443/TCP          3h44m
```

Visit the service (at port 5000) in your browser:

## Instrument your service

Great! Now you're running an application in Kubernetes. Next, you'll instrument it with New Relic using a [custom manifest](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure#customized-manifest).

First, install `kube-state-metrics`:

```console
$ curl -L -o kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v1.9.5.zip && unzip kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics-1.9.5/examples/standard
...
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kube-state-metrics created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kube-state-metrics created
deployment.apps/kube-state-metrics created
serviceaccount/kube-state-metrics created
service/kube-state-metrics created
```

Second, download the infrastructure agent manifest:

```console
$ curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml
```

Replace `<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>` and `<YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>` in _newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml_:

```yaml
env:
  - name: "CLUSTER_NAME"
    value: "<YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>"
  - name: "NRIA_LICENSE_KEY"
    value: "<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>"
```

Use `Kube-Lab-2` for `<YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>`.

You can find your license key at New Relic:

1. [Log in](https://one.newrelic.com/)
2. Navigate to _Account settings_ from your profile at the top right of the screen
3. Your License key is on the right side, under _Account information_

Next, create the Kubernetes resources:

```console
$ kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml
serviceaccount/newrelic created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/newrelic created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/newrelic created
daemonset.apps/newrelic-infra created
configmap/nri-default-integration-cfg created
configmap/nri-integration-cfg created
```

Finally, wait a few minutes and navigate to the [Kubernetes Explorer](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/understand-use-data/kubernetes-cluster-explorer):

1. [Log in](https://one.newrelic.com/)
2. Select _Infrastructure_ from the top navigation
3. Select _NR1 Kubernetes cluster explorer_ on the right side of the screen

![Navigate to the Cluster Explorer](static/cluster_explorer_link.png)

Select the _Kube-Lab-2_ cluster:

> **Don't panic!** If you see a message about incomplete data for the cluster, refresh in a few minutes.

## Tear down

You can remove all your resources from this lab by spinning down Minikube:

```console
$ minikube stop
$ minikube delete
```

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed and instrumented an app in Kubernetes using a custom manifest. You can use this method if you need more granular control over your resources. In the final lab, you'll learn how to instrument a Kubernetes cluster built with Helm.

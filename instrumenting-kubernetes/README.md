# Instrumenting Kubernetes with New Relic

Containerized applications and Kubernetes are hot topics in the tech world today. Do you have an app running in Kubernetes? Is your system a black box, and you'd like to see what's happening in there? Would you prefer a machine tell you that your app is broken, rather than a user? You've come to the right session...

In this talk, you'll learn how you can deploy and instrument an application in Kubernetes with New Relic.

**Presenter:** Stijn Polfliet - Principal TechOps Strategy Consultant

## Requirements

Please follow all the instructions in the [prerequisite guide](REQUIREMENTS.md) before attending. This will ensure that you are ready for the hands-on labs section. We want you to spend your lab time learning rather than setting up your environment.

## Labs

This session includes four labs, each with its own directory, relating to the presentation. Each directory has a README that contains the instructions you'll need to complete the lab:

- [Lab 1](labs/kube-lab-1/README.md)
- [Lab 2](labs/kube-lab-2/README.md)
- [Lab 3](labs/kube-lab-3/README.md)
- [Lab 4](labs/kube-lab-4/README.md)
